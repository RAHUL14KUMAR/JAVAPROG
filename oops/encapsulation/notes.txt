encapsulation in java is wraping code and data together in a single files;
the data in a class can be hidden from another class so it also known as data hidding;

main importance is-
1- hides the data
2- data is not accessble from other class aur acceble ho toh restricted form mae

how we can acheive encapsulation
1-> declare the variable of the class be private
2-> implement the getter and settter methods to read and write the variables


4 types of access modifiers
1- private -> within the class
2- default -> access only within the package (in this case our package is oops)
3- protected ->access within and outside the package through making child class
4- puclic ->access to anyOne
